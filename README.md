## Calculates the main elements of a projectile.

**Asks for 3 input parameters**
-	Initial height from ground in meters
-	Initial velocity in meters per second
-	the launching angle in degrees

**Calculates**
-	Horizontal velocity in meters per second 
-	Initial vertical velocity in meters per second
-	Maximum height from the point of launch in meters
-	Maximum height from ground in meters
-	Time to ascend in seconds
-	Time to descend in seconds
-	Total travel time in seconds
-	Horizontal distance where reached maximum height in meters
-	Maximum horizontal distance in meters

**Displays the trajectory graph**

**Trajectory1.py** is written using procedural programming
**Trajectory2.py** is written using object-oriented programming (OOP)
